### Goal
The goal of the coursework to understand the basics of coding, how machine learning works, how to train the model, gain understanding of how to use LLMs, how to write prompts and learn to use GitHub

### Part 1, brief overview
During Part 1, I was learning basics of GitHub, I created a new repository where I pushed all the changes that made throughout the project. This was my first experience with version control and collaboration using GitHub, and this thing is quite important for building a project with others

### Part 2, brief overview
In Part 2, I spent a long time for understanding the fundamentals of coding such variables, functions, conditions, and loops. For quick learning I was using chatGPT, where I needed to understand how to properly write the prompts and practical examples for them. Also it helped me a lot to understand how to manipulate the pictures and even sounds

### Part 3, brief overview
During Part 3, the main task for learning how machine learning works. By having the practical example of how to train a model by the provided dataset,  i needed to use my previously gained knowledges of python basics. This helped me a lot to understand the main concept of the AI is used in the real webpages such as ChatGPT and how the LLMs actually trains and used. 

### Part 4, brief overview
For part 4, I combined all the gained knowledges  from previous parts to create an interactive tool. The Cultural Story Generator leverages LLMs and Spotify APIs to make a personalised and immersive storytelling about artworks in museums and galleries. This tool allows users to learn the history behind paintings in different tones (dramatic, funny, modern slang), accompanied by music that matches the painting's vibe (the project overview is on the notebook part4.ipynb)
